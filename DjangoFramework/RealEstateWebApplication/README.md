13) Open webapp folder located inside RealEstateWebApplication folder. This location contains files that we mostly work on. models.py, views.py and urls.py are espicially important.

14) Template folder and static folder contains html and css files.

NOTE: django looks for collections prefixed with app name. For example, if we want to insert document to home collection, django will insert to webapp_home collection. because there could be multiple apps inside main project and db properties are defined in settings.py which is common.
